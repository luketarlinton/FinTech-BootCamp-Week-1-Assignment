# **Week 1 Assignment: Payments/Billings - Square Inc. Case Study**
----
## **Overview and Origin:**

This report will showcase an in-depth overview of the company Block Inc (as of Dec 2021), formerly known as Square Inc. I will be referring to the company now named Block as Square for the remainder of this case study as it is the most recognisable name for the company at the time of writing this report.

Square was incorporated and founded in 2009 by Jack Dorsey and Jim McKelvey. The idea for Square came from quite a rudimentary problem in the life of co-founder Jim McKelvey. At the time Jim was an artisan that was trying to sell a $2,000 piece to a keen buyer. However, the deal fell through as the buyer couldn’t front the entire amount in cash for the purchase and Jim wasn’t in a position to accept payment via credit card.

This $2,000 loss for Jim lead to a small idea that snowballed into an enormous game changer in the payments sector. He and Jack Dorsey combined their knowledge to create a payment experience that would control both ends of the payments market.

To date, Square has raised $601.2 million in funding from 44 key investors including Lightbank and GGV Capital. It’s most recent funding round was in May 2021, through a post-IPO funding round.

In 2009 Square ran a series A funding round, raising $10 million from early investors including former Yahoo! CEO Marissa Mayer and Twitter co-founder Biz Stone. In 2011, they ran their second round of funding raising $27.5 million with Visa purchasing a small stake in the company. In its third round of funding, Square raised $100 million and in 2012 Starbucks invested $25 million as part of their series D funding round which generated $200 million in funding. Square then raised a further $150 million in a private funding round in 2014.

In 2015 Square became a publicly traded company when it made an initial public offering and listed on the New York Stock Exchange.

## **Business Activities:**

Prior to Square’s inception in 2009 small businesses faced a considerable barrier to growth as a result of their inability to process credit card payments. Square aimed and achieved the creation of a solution to this issue by providing a simple and cheap method for small businesses to accept credit card payments at the point of sale and without overly expensive service fees.

At the time processing credit card payments for smaller businesses was inconceivable as processing costs could amount to 6% of a sale. Another issue small businesses faced was their poor access to sales analytics data. Square aimed to solve this problem by creating their register product. This tablet product that featured square’s software was able to completely replace any businesses cash register. 

Square’s overall aim was to design a system that would completely redefine the payments system for businesses from end to end. In 2013 Square began targeting larger businesses by expanding its offering.

It released an app called “Cash” that allowed users to transfer money from one another’s bank accounts instantaneously rather than wait days to transfer funds between bank accounts via banking solutions. This app’s main competitors were PayPal, and Stripe however Cash’s point of difference was their app was designed like a social app that made the experience fun for the user rather than the usual banking or finance app design. This led to wider adoption of the Cash app and was also a clever way for Square to acquire more user data as the Cash app required users to connect a checking account to Square’s payment back-end.

In 2014, Square released Square Capital which offered small businesses loans that would be repaid to Square via a percentage of all the businesses card sales overtime. This gave businesses access to loans that they usual couldn’t through traditional banking systems and was a unique way of lending money as there was no structured repayment timeline.

In 2016 Square sought to take control of the market share in Australia by offering a 1.9% fee per transaction as opposed to its 2.75% charge in the US.

Square’s cash app also got an update in 2018 whereby it supported the trading and exchange of Bitcoin. It also enabled users to begin to receive their pay checks via direct deposit directly via the app. This negated the users need for mainstream banks and expanded Square’s offering to consist of the majority of the main services offered by traditional banking institutions that the younger generation of millennials require/want.

Square further expanded its offering in 2018 when it acquired website creation service, Weebly. This allowed Square to offer its customers the ability to create websites for their small businesses before providing them a large range of financial services for their growing business.

Square further developed their readers, from which the company begun, in 2018 by allowing their clients to customise their customers checkout experiences which further separated themselves from competitors. Another new development was the readers ability to process chip enabled cards (pay pass) within two seconds.

Square’s intended target customer base is made up of small – medium sized businesses that are looking to grow, accept credit card payments and thereby expanding their customer base. These businesses will be looking to move toward cashless payment systems. Their core business solutions, software and banking like services are aimed at being the perfect end to end payment solution for the seller.

According to Square’s investor report in September 2021, the market opportunity of their seller business is $100 billion plus. Square suggests they have only captured around 3% of this potential market which leaves enormous room for growth. The Seller opportunity within the US is $85 billion plus, stemming from roughly 20 million businesses and $6 trillion in gross receipts.

This $85 billion revenue opportunity within the US is broken down into four main segments;

- $39 billion from transaction profits
- $30 billion in software
- $12 billion in Square loans
- $5 billion in financial services

With an additional $16 billion in transaction profit from international markets

The report also suggests they are looking to expand their customer base by aiming their offerings toward larger sellers producing $250,000 to $100 million in annual gross receipts.

Square’s main competitors are Shopify, PayPal, Clover, Stripe, Intuit and ShopKeep by Lightspeed.

While Square may lack the same level of scale than that of PayPal it offers a broad range of payment solutions and is constantly innovating to further broaden its software and solution offering.

Square separates themselves from competitors by offering complementary services such as data analytics and customer relationship software.

Square was and is a key disrupter in the payments market and until recent years was the first to offer small businesses the ability to accept credit card payments with their transaction fee only model while the major traditional players charge monthly fees on top of transaction fees and have complex contracts. Square is easy to setup and use for any small business owner and their accompanying software and product range simplify payments for any business.

Square’s main point of difference is its heavier focus on in person transactions within brick-and-mortar stores whilst many of its competitors mainly focus on facilitating online transactions. This has led them to create a seamless in person user experience with its card readers, terminals and point of sales systems with quick functionality, leaving customers of Square’s clients experiencing near instant transaction processing when paying for their goods or services.

Square is also versatile, enabling its customers to accept credit card payments, manage their inventory, complete payroll tasks via their service Vend and seamless and user-friendly point of sale systems. Square can sell directly to its clients enabling the business to provide reliable support and control its products and offerings completely. It also offers highly competitive pricing models in which it’s vendors can select the right plan that suits their needs and avoids fixed priced plans like many of its competitors.

Overall, its simplicity, user friendly technology and software accompanied by its direct communication with businesses and its wide range of offerings sets Square apart from its growing number of competitors.

In addition, the switching costs of Square make it one of the strongest businesses in the payments market. Due to its nature of being a one stop shop for managing a new/small business’ payments with its wide product/service offering it cements itself as the sole payments provider for many businesses. As a new business commences trading with Square it will grow leading to increased employment, resulting in the need for capital which can be arranged via business loans from Square, it will have payroll needs and industry specific point of sales solution needs that can all be facilitated by Square. This payments ecosystem that Square has created with its offering will negate its customers from switching to another provider/competitor as it would be too costly and disruptive to its day-to-day business activities. The end result of this structure will see Square grow with these new businesses as they become larger or expand into franchises.

In terms of technology Square utilises machine learning to complete automated risk assessments whilst maintaining high acceptance rates within its loan business, Square Capital. Square utilises programming languages Ruby and Java, their client libraries utilise Ember and they use Jetty:// for HTTP server technology. The server libraries Square uses are Rails and Protocol Buffers and the databases and NoSQL datastores they utilise are PostgreSQL, MySQL, Hadoop and Redis.

## **Landscape:**

Square’s business is within the payments/billing domain of the financial industry.

Over the last decade the payments/billing domain has seen a huge shift towards online/electronic payments and a move away from cash-based payments. According to the RBA, Australian’s “made around 10.7 billion debit and credit card purchases worth $677 billion” in 2019/20. The RBA also states that according to the “Bank’s 2019 Consumer Payments Survey, debit cards have now overtaken cash as the most commonly used payment method by Australian consumers”.

Following along with this downward trend in cash use and wide adoption of debit cards, contactless payment methods via pay pass, using chip enabled cards or cardless payments via Apple Pay, have become increasingly popular. This has seen a move away the use of eftpos machines, to a wider adoption and trust of competitive newcomers such as Square.

There has also been a shift in how people bank and transfer funds both domestically and internationally with consumers widely adopting online banking and transferring funds via their smart phones using both banking apps and payment splitting apps such as Beem It. 

A heavier use of direct debits has also increased over the last decade with consumers opting to pay for services via online direct debit services for items such as paying their utility bills to leisure services such as Netflix and Spotify. There has also been an uptake in buy now, pay later apps such as Afterpay in the retail space.
The major companies within this domain are the card brands being Visa, Mastercard, American Express etc. They oversee transactions between businesses and credit card issuers. Then there are issuing banks such as HSBC that issue credit cards overseen by the card brands. These banks are responsible for financially banking the transactions made using these credit cards by consumers. Then there are the acquiring banks such as Citi bank that act as the businesses bank, who accept payments from credit cards. These banks settle the daily card payments made by consumers to businesses into the business’ bank account. 

In addition to this there are payment gateways such as Stripe and Square that encrypt payment data for say a payment made for an online purchase and send this data to the businesses acquiring bank. There are also payment service providers and independent sales organisations such as Zomaron.

The former companies I described are more traditional players in the payment’s domain. The new later players are companies such as Square, Stripe, PayPal, Apple Pay, Neo Banks etc that are competing against their traditional counterparts.

Square and its ‘new age’ competitors provide smaller and perhaps even larger businesses an alternative to overly expensive traditional payment providers.

## **Results:**

The business impact of Square has had a dramatic effect on small business’ ability to accept credit card/debit card payments globally. Square’s business is helping to grow a considerable number of companies world-wide and providing them with the means to manage their payments seamlessly and affordably. Small brick and mortar shops are now able to move away from cash only businesses and grow their customer base due to the ease the consumer experiences in paying for their goods and services.

They are also helping to give small businesses access to capital that they usually wouldn’t be eligible for and provide them with the tools they’ll need once they do achieve growth.

The key metric of success for companies such as Square, is GPV or gross payments volume. It tracks the total dollar amount being transacted through its payment system. Square was hit hard by the recent pandemic as the vast majority of its payment processing comes via brick-and-mortar businesses which were closed or received far less business than usual. The pandemic also slowed down the rate of creation of new brick and mortar businesses. Square was hit harder than a competitor such as Stripe which receives much of its payments volume from online transactions, which actually increased over the course of the pandemic.
Square charges a transaction fee on these payments and these fees account for a large proportion of Square’s total revenue.

Another key metric is the number of companies using the payment service a business such a Square provides. This directly correlates to the number of payments Square will process as the more clients Square acquires the greater the number of payments it facilitates and therefore the greater amount of revenue it can generate via transaction fees.

Statista.com states Square’s transaction revenue equated to $3.29 billion in 2019. Wallstreetzen.com indicates that in 2020, $112.295 billion in payments were made on Square’s platform. Square underperformed compared with that of Venmo ($159 billion in payments made on their platform) and Zelle ($307 billion in payments via their platform). Although Square’s gross payment volume has increased steadily year on year since its inception.	

According to Slintel.com Square holds a 22.12% share of the POS Systems category. It also states that 20,207 companies utilise Square’s POS systems. Slintel.com also suggests that Square holds 2.62% share of the Payment Management category and 29,780 companies utilise Square’s payment management systems. This is considerably smaller than juggernaut PayPal’s 30.89% share and 351,237 business clients or Stripe’s 17.35% market share and 197,232 business clients.

## **Recommendations:**

In the coming years, Square should utilise a data-driven approach to further develop additional personal and small business finance products. They should provide more niche industry specific products/solutions as it has with restaurants and retail businesses. Its more tailored payment solutions would separate itself from its larger competitors.

Square could also develop solutions for identity-based payment systems which could utilise blockchain technology. Square clearly has a strong belief in new financial technology and cryptocurrency, with its considerable investments in Bitcoin and the introduction of cryptocurrency within its Cash App.

Square is a data rich company which stems from both its Cash App business and Square POS solutions which has led to it collating large amount of data from both the business side of the market and the consumer side of the economy. 

The company could leverage this data to acquire businesses and successfully enter fields such as insurance and healthcare. Square could also develop solutions that are tailored toward the growing gig economy which is made up of a labour force that works via short term contracts and freelance work instead of more traditional full time permanent positions.
 
Another way in which Square could leverage this data is to begin incentivising the consumers that utilise their Cash App to shop at Square sellers. They could do this by offering discounts and rewards programs to consumers who shop at these businesses. This would directly boot its gross payment volumes. In addition to this Square can begin offering its seller businesses the opportunity to promote their business through the Cash App to consumers in their area. Square could offer this promotional tool for a fee, leading new streams of revenue. Square can advocate the use of this promotional tool to their seller businesses by utilising their data to show their customers how many Cash App users are within a particular radius of their business and the types of stores these consumers frequent. This use of data not only boosts revenue through existing clients and consumers but will bring in more customers for both the Cash App and the Square sellers’ business.

If you were to flesh this concept out further, these seller businesses could act as sales agents for the Cash App as Square could lower their transaction fees incrementally for payments made via the Cash App at these stores, which would incentivise businesses to promote the use of Cash App within their stores.

An additional way in which Square could further leverage their data is via its lending business. Square can further improve its existing machine learning automated risk assessment software to offer its business customers even more flexible loans as its technology becomes better informed with the more data it is exposed to. These companies can then pay back these loans via their daily card sales further lowering the risk to Square. In addition, Square could further utilise their consumer data via the Cash App to begin lending out to consumers as it would have extensive data on their payment habits. This would allow Square to lend out small loans to those individuals who may not be able to obtain loans from more traditional institutions.

By leveraging its data to enter new markets, make further smart acquisitions, grow its loan business, begin to offer loans to consumers, create a promotional model leveraging both consumers and businesses to create further payments which develop new streams of income and further tailor its payment solutions to industry specific niches, Square will completely separate itself from the pack of new age payment/billing companies and especially from its traditional counterparts.

Square is in a unique position that many businesses don’t find themselves in and that’s due to its extraordinary data haul from both businesses and consumers. Using this data, Square will be able to make more informed decisions that accurately reflect customers’ needs and wants and offer tailored solutions that larger competitors can’t match. This would be an intelligent move as it would be going after clients that larger traditional payment providers wouldn’t consider thus lowering its level of competition.

Taking these steps Square will promote strong growth in its gross payments volume and revenue from its transaction fees.
